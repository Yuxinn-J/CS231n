In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training
Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment
are as follows:

- understand **Neural Networks** and how they are arranged in layered
  architectures
- understand and be able to implement (vectorized) **backpropagation**
- implement various **update rules** used to optimize Neural Networks
- implement **Batch Normalization** and **Layer Normalization** for training deep networks
- implement **Dropout** to regularize networks
- understand the architecture of **Convolutional Neural Networks** and
  get practice with training these models on data
- gain experience with a major deep learning framework, such as **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.

## Setup
Get the code as a zip file [here](http://cs231n.github.io/assignments/2018/spring1718_assignment2.zip).

You can follow the setup instructions [here](http://cs231n.github.io/setup-instructions/).

**NOTE: At this time, the PyTorch and TensorFlow notebooks for Question 5 are not finalized. We will update this page with a zip file containing the two notebooks and installation instructions as soon as they are completed.**

### Download data:
Once you have the starter code, you will need to download the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Run the following from the `assignment2` directory:

```bash
cd cs231n/datasets
./get_datasets.sh
```

### Start IPython:
After you have the CIFAR-10 data, you should start the IPython notebook server from the
`assignment2` directory, with the `jupyter notebook` command. (See the [Google Cloud Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/gce-tutorial/) for any additional steps you may need to do for setting this up, if you are working remotely).

If you are unfamiliar with IPython, you can also refer to our
[IPython tutorial](/ipython-tutorial).

### Some Notes
**NOTE 1:** This year, the `assignment2` code has been tested to be compatible with python version `3.6` (it may work with other versions of `3.x`, but we won't be officially supporting them). You will need to make sure that during your virtual environment setup that the correct version of `python` is used. You can confirm your python version by (1) activating your virtualenv and (2) running `which python`.

**NOTE 2:** If you are working in a virtual environment on OSX, you may *potentially* encounter
errors with matplotlib due to the [issues described here](http://matplotlib.org/faq/virtualenv_faq.html). In our testing, it seems that this issue is no longer present with the most recent version of matplotlib, but if you do end up running into this issue you may have to use the `start_ipython_osx.sh` script from the `assignment2` directory (instead of `jupyter notebook` above) to launch your IPython notebook server. Note that you may have to modify some variables within the script to match your version of python/installation directory. The script assumes that your virtual environment is named `.env`.

### Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (20 points)
The IPython notebook `FullyConnectedNets.ipynb` will introduce you to our
modular layer design, and then use those layers to implement fully-connected
networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models you will implement several
popular update rules.

### Q2: Batch Normalization (30 points)
In the IPython notebook `BatchNormalization.ipynb` you will implement batch
normalization, and use it to train deep fully-connected networks.

### Q3: Dropout (10 points)
The IPython notebook `Dropout.ipynb` will help you implement Dropout and explore
its effects on model generalization.

### Q4: Convolutional Networks (30 points)
In the IPython Notebook ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb you will implement several new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks.

### Q5: PyTorch / TensorFlow on CIFAR-10 (10 points)
For this last part, you will be working in either TensorFlow or PyTorch, two popular and powerful deep learning frameworks. **You only need to complete ONE of these two notebooks.** You do NOT need to do both, and we will _not_ be awarding extra credit to those who do. 

Open up either `PyTorch.ipynb` or `TensorFlow.ipynb`. There, you will learn how the framework works, culminating in training a  convolutional network of your own design on CIFAR-10 to get the best performance you can.

**NOTE: Once again, at this time, the PyTorch and TensorFlow notebooks are not finalized. We will update this page with a zip file containing the two notebooks as soon as they are completed!**
